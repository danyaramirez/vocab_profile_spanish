# Vocabulary Profile for Spanish Texts

# Overview
This tools provides a visualization of the vocabulary profile of texts in Spanish.

# What is "vocabulary profile"?
Vocabulary profile is defined here as the characteristics of a text (text file) regarding the use frequency of the words in the text (c.f. Mark Davies' Corpus del EspaÃ±ol). Also, we include the ratio of unique word per total number of words (lexical variability), and the ratio of unique content words per total number of content words (lexical density).  This is a useful tool for Spanish language teachers to know the general level of difficulty their texts convey.

# Basic characteristics:
The code was created in Python 3.8.

The repo includes:
> A .py file with the code

> A .csv file with the corpus list

# Output:
It creates:

> a dataframe with the details of frequency ranges and number of tokens in that range

> a pie chart with the percentage of the text for each frequency range

> a bar chart that compares number of words in the text, lexical variability and lexical density

> a word cloud pointing at the most used words

# Some recommendations:
Make sure the text file is correctly encoded in utf-8.
